		<dl>
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">Soical Media Website with a Login system connected to MySql database
				<dd style = "margin-left:2%">Website build under HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, PHP, and MySql. User can sign up for the page if they do not have an account. If the email or username is already taken, if will let the user know. Then, the information will be sent to MySql database using PHP. After signing up, user can login using their credentials.
					User can upload a profile picture that will be loaded everytime when the user login. </dd> 
			
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">Self Check-Out using Java (Software Engineering) 
				<dd style= "margin-left:2%">Application contain user side, client side, and stocker side that work interactively with each other. Using software engineering principles, this application contain classes with operations, a communication diagram for each use case and a software architechural design.</dd>
				
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">Logical Interpreter using C++ </dt>
				<dd style = "margin-left:2%">Take a .txt file as input that contain logical expressions such as "TvT","T->F", "((TvT)->(T->F))vF", etc. Returns the result in a string contain either 'T' or 'F'.</dd>
		
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">KD-Tree using C</dt>
				<dd style = "margin-left:2%"> Take input that contain array of points that has D number of dimensions. Then, divide the array into two parts using bipartion function to find the new centroids (centers). Keep doing this untill there is K clusters or K centroids and mapped points each center. 
									 	Input a point that contains D dimensions and using the KD-Search, it can find the closest point by finding the closest centroid then comparing the distance between the query point and the points in that cluster.</dd>
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">K-Means using C 
				<dd style = "margin-left:2%">Clustering algorithm like KD-Tree that is above. It intializes the centers: first center is randomly intializes, the second center is the furthest from first center and everything after upto K will be found by finding the mininum distance between the previous centers.Then, taking the maximum of that minimum centers. The points will be clustered according to the centers after.
										The search is the same as the KD-Tree above. </dd>
			<dt style="margin-left:1%">Resume written using HTML and CSS
					<dd style = "margin-left:2%">Resume written using HTML and CSS combined. It uses basic HTML and CSS. Source code can be found in my Github.</dd>
